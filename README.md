game-server
===========

The motivation for this project was to create a server for games where you sit around a TV
with friends and everyone uses their smartphone as input devices. This provides an interesting
twist to games as you essentially have a way to secretly display information to the players 
individually. 

The game basically works for a free-form game of tic-tac-toe at the moment, thought it's quite buggy.
